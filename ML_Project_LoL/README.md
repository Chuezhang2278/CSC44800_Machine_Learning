## What is league of legends? 
- League of legends is a multiplayer game that pits two teams of 5 against each other in which they must employ different strategies in order to win.
- Each team has 148 champions that they can pick to fight against the enemy and this is where the strategy comes in because every champion has their own unique abilities
- Each match you play can range from 10 minutes to up to over an hour, everything depends on the strategies that each team uses
